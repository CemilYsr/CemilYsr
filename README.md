## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a backend-oriented web developer who focuses on building solid foundations rather than superficial solutions.  
During my university education, I specialized in **algorithms, backend development, and database management**.

I completed my internship at **MorePayroll Kenacademy**, where I actively worked on **PHP-based projects** and gained real-world experience in:
- CRUD operations  
- Form handling  
- Database integrations  
- Hosting and cPanel management  

Thanks to my background in information security, I approach backend development with a **security-aware mindset**.
